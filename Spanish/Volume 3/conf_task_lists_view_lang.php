	//IMPORTANT NOTES FOR TRANSLATORS:
	//0. For each line, do not change anything before the "=" sign.
	//1. Replace text inside "" (double quotes).
	//2. If you need to add double quotes on the text, do this: \" for each double quote you would like to enter.
	//3. if there's a link in the middle of the text, the sentence is split in:
	//	part 1: text before the link
	//	part 2: text of the link
	//	part 3: text after the link
	//4. Never leave trailing spaces
	//5. Keep sentences in one line only, even if very long.
	//6. If a line starts with // that means it is a comment line. Leave it as it is.
	//7. Try to keep the number of chars on your translation at about the same lenght as the English version
